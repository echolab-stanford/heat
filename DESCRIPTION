Description: The 'heat' package (Harmonized Envrionmental Exposure Aggregation Tools) aggregates environmental raster data to environmental exposures for any 'sf' dataframe of administrative boundaries or point locations. 'heat' supports nonlinear transformations (polynomials, splines, bins and custom functions) and aggregating the exposures to the desired temporal resolution. The package can process large datasets with decades of high-resolution raster data efficiently by automatically splitting the data into batches.
